This project contains several program written in C related to pointers, arrays, and strings.

MANDATORY:

0. Write a function that concatenates two strings
   * Append *src* string to *dest* string, overwriting the null byte at the end of *dest*
   * Add a new null byte to the end of concatenated string
1. Write a function that concatenates two strings
   * Use, at most, n bytes from *src*
   * *src* does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
2. Write a function that copies a string
3. Write a function that compares two strings
4. Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers
5. Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase
6. Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string
7. Write a function that encodes a string into 1337
8. Write a function that encodes a string into rot13

ADVANCED:

9. Write a function that prints an integer
10. Add one line to the existing file *magic.c* so that the program prints a[2] = 98
11. Write a function that adds two numbers
12. Write a function that prints a buffer
