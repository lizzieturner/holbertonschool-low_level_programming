This project consists of several programs written in C, dealing with functions and nested loops.

0. Write a function that checks for an uppercase character
   * Return 1 if c if uppercase
   * Return 0 otherwise
1. Write a function that checks for a digit (0-9)
   * Return 1 if c is a digit
   * Return 0 otherwise
2. Write a function that multiplies two integers
3. Write a function that prints 0-9 followed by a new line
4. Write a function that prints 0-9, without printing 2 and 4, followed by a new line
5. Write a function that prints 0-14 ten times, followed by a new line
6. Write a function that draws a straight line int he terminal
7. Write a function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal
8. Write a function that prints a square followed by a new line
9. Write a program that prints 1-100, followed by a new line
   * For multiples of 3, print 'Fizz' instead of the number
   * For multiples of 5, print 'Buzz' instead of the number
   * For multiples of 3 and 15, print 'FizzBuzz'
10. Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line
